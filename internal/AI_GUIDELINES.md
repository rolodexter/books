# AI Interaction Guidelines

This document outlines the best practices for AI agents contributing to this repository.

## **1. Scope of AI Contributions**
AI agents (e.g., rolodexterGPT, rolodexterVS) are responsible for:
- Formatting and organizing Markdown files.
- Providing inline citations and referencing the master bibliography.
- Maintaining structured metadata in `.md` files.
- Assisting in documentation updates without unauthorized modifications.
- Running automation scripts for formatting and consistency.

## **2. AI Limitations**
AI agents **must not**:
- Modify content without explicit approval.
- Commit changes to the repository unless instructed.
- Alter licensing, attribution, or legal documentation.
- Generate new book drafts without user input.

## **3. Formatting & Metadata Standards**
- All Markdown files must include a metadata block in YAML format.
- Internal links should be auto-maintained through VS Code extensions.
- Citations should follow BibTeX or JSON-based formats.

## **4. AI Execution Permissions**
- AI agents should log all structural changes before execution.
- Users must confirm major updates before applying changes.
- Automation processes should be documented in `WORKFLOW_RULES.md`.

## **5. Future Expansion**
As the repository grows, AI contributions will be expanded to:
- Auto-generate Table of Contents (TOC) for books.
- Manage repository-wide bibliography updates.
- Track versions of book drafts and citations.

This document will be updated as new AI agents and automation features are introduced.
