# Metadata Standards for Markdown Files

This document establishes best practices for structuring metadata in Markdown (`.md`) files within the repository.

## **1. Metadata Format**
All Markdown files should include a **YAML front matter block** at the beginning, formatted as follows:
```yaml
---
title: "Book Title or Document Name"
author: "Joseph Maristela III"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
version: "1.0"
citations:
  - id: "einstein1905"
  - id: "maristela2023"
license: "CC BY 4.0"
category: "Fiction | Nonfiction | Research | Reference"
tags: ["AI", "blockchain", "science"]
---
```

This document will be updated as metadata standards evolve.
